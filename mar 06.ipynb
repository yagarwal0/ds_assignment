    "Understanding the level of measurement is crucial in data analysis to apply appropriate statistical techniques. <br>For Example, let's consider a survey where respondents rate their satisfaction with a product on a scale of 1 to 5 (ordinal level). If we mistakenly treat these ratings as numerical values and calculate the mean, it would lead to incorrect conclusions. Instead, using the median or mode for central tendency and non-parametric tests for analysis would be more appropriate. Understanding the level of measurement ensures accurate analysis and prevents misinterpretation of the data."
