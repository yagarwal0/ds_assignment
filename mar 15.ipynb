    "Anomaly detection using unsupervised learning involves preprocessing data, selecting an appropriate unsupervised algorithm (e.g., density-based, distance-based, clustering, or autoencoders), and training the model on normal data. The model then computes anomaly scores for each data point, identifying deviations from normal behavior. High anomaly scores indicate potential anomalies. Unsupervised methods are advantageous when labeled anomalous data is scarce or costly to obtain, and they can adapt to changing data distributions and detect novel anomalies. Challenges include setting an appropriate anomaly threshold and handling anomalies similar to normal data. Semi-supervised approaches can improve accuracy by combining labeled and unlabeled data for detection."
